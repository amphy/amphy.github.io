hi, i'm <span class="text-japan-pink">heather</span>

<img class="rounded-lg max-w-md w-full md:inline-block" src='/img/heather.jpg' />

I graduated from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://cs.illinois.edu/) (UIUC) in May 2020 with my Master's degree in Computer Science. My research focus is in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with my thesis focusing on visualizing diversity in the fashion industry. I show a few possible ways to visualize data collected from six different brands that could help with understanding whether the fashion industry is doing better or not in terms of diversity. I really enjoy data visualization, especially to help propel forward social change.

Before pursuing my Master's degree, I worked for a year at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://lanl.gov/) as a post-baccalaureate student researcher after finishing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the [University of Georgia](https://www.cs.uga.edu/). At Los Alamos, I focused on two projects: investigating memory faults in computer hardware to determine the accuracy of current error notifications and refactoring an internal Python program that helped with schedling jobs on super computers.

Most recently, I interned at [Blend](https://blend.com/) as a software engineering intern. While at Blend, I was able to learn about many different parts of the stack since my team dealt with multiple aspects of the product. Additionally, my project focused on creating a production solution for secure storage, transportaion, and usage of sensitive, PII-ful documents and data. 

In addition to diversity and inclusivity in STEM, I'm passionate about teaching. I've participated in many [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us) events and also worked as a summer camp instructor for [iD Tech Camps](https://www.idtech.com/). I was also a teaching assistant for [AddisCoder](https://www.addiscoder.com/), a program that focused on bringing Introduction to Computer Science education to Ethiopia. In the future, I'd love to participate in a program that helps with making resources (classes, technology, etc) more easily accessible to students interested in Computer Science.
