AirTalk is a web chat application made for HackGT 2015. The goal of AirTalk was to help alleviate boredom that passengers at airports feel when waiting for their flights. It also aimed to connect passengers on flights in a less intimidating way. It was made using Python, Socket.IO, and a Flask backend.

The code can be found on GitHub and the promotional video can be found here.
