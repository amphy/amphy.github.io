Buildr is a web application built for the Riot API Challenge. The goal was to utilize data for the URF game mode to create a cool application for League of Legends players. This application shows a random item build pulled from the URF data for a picked champion. It is made using Python and Flask.

The completed project can be seen here and code hosted on GitHub.
