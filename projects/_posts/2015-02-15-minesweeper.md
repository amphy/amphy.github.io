For a class assignment, we were tasked with recreating Minesweeper using Java. Users can interact with the game using the command line with the results of their actions being shown on the console. A user can either start a random game or inpur a seed file that denotes a premade field. There is also a no-fog command to help with debugging while developing since normally the user cannot see where all the mines are on the board.
