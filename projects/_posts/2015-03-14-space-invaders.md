Space Invaders was an assignment in my second level Introduction to Computer Science class at UGA (CSCI 1302). For this assignment, I used Java with JavaFX to create my first graphical game. This game plays like the original Space Invaders game where the user's goal is to kill all the invaders without getting hit. The game also included an animated start screen.
