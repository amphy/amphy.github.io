Social Forecast is a web application that maps tweets on a map using the Google Maps API as a heatmap where places with more tweets will show up red and places with less tweets will show up green. In addition to mapping tweet density, we also provide analytics ranging from sentiment analysis using the IBM Watson API to demographic information about a particular area on the map.
