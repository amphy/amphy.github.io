Is It A Cat is a simple web application that tells you if an image contains a cat or not. The results will show if the image is a cat or not as well as a list of tags associated with that image. The application is meant to be a starter application for people who may want to use the Clarifai API and don't know how to get started. It is made using the Clarifai API, a Flask backend, and hosted on Heroku.

The completed project can be seen here and the code hosted on GitHub.
