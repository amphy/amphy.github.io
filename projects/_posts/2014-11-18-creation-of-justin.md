The Creation of Justin is a parody of the famous painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel: The Creation of Adam. During my study abroad trip in Italy, we saw the Sistine Chapel which inspired us to create photographs with a similar theme. This website was created as a way to display all of these photographs.

This project was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
