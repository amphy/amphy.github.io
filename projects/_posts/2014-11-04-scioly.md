Science Olympiad Outreach @ UGA was an organization I helped create as an undergraduate student at the University of Georgia. I was inspired by my experience participating in Science Olympiad in high school and also through volunteering at tournaments that were organized by Emory University. This website was originally created to give information about how to get involved with Science Olympiad at UGA as well as information on when our tournaments were taking place. It was created using just HTML and CSS.
