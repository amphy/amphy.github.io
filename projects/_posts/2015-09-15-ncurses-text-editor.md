This text editor was created for CSCI 1730. It is made with C++ and the NCurses library. There is a menu that can be opened with F1 which allows you to open files, save files, and save files as a new name. It also lets you exit. The text in the editor changes color as you type. At the bottom, it displays the file name of the currently opened file.
