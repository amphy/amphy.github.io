Lithium is a music production center (MPC) made using LeapMotion and Java. Users control a virtual sampler using a variety of hand gestures to produce difference sounds. The volume can also be changed. The sounds can be displayed graphically on the screen and background music can also be played with it. The DevPost and website have additional information. The code is hosted on GitHub.
