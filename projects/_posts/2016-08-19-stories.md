Stories is a project that I'm using to display fictional stories I write. It is built using Jekyll as a base. I added AJAX to asynchronously load posts in order to perform the animations from page to page. I also edited the CSS and templates.

The completed project can be seen [here](https://stories.heabuh.com).
