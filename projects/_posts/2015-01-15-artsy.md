This program was created for CSCI 1302. It is made with Java and makes use of Java 8 functionalities like Lambda functions. The user can open two pictures and perform rotations (clockwise or counter clockwise) on them. After, the user can choose from three choices (vertical stripes, horizontal stripes, and checkered) to mix up their two images. This new resulting image cna be saved. There is a konami code implemented that pops up a picture of Grumpy Cat.
