Love Notes is a cute way to store text you type and send it as messages to people you care about. The application uses JavaScript to track your typing speed and uses that information to retype your message word for word, backspaces included! This was built using JavaScript, Python, and Flask.

The completed porject can be seen here and the code is on GitHub.
