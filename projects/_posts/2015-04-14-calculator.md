This was a calculator created for a class assignment in the second level Introduction to Computer Science course at UGA (CSCI 1302). This calculator shows both the binary representation of the current number on the screen as well as any previous operations performed. The calculator internally supports both recursive and iterative implementations of all the basic functions. It also supports bit shifting and has a konami code easter egg that pops up a game of pong.
